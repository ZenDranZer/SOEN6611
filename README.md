SOEN6611 - Team E
=======================

In this project we are evaluating various open source projects in order to categarize the projects. We have used various different metrics and performed corelation analysis based on the output file generated by these metrics.
We need to perform various test suits in order to achieve full coverage of the project and then evaluate the project. To do so we have selected below mentioed metrics.
1. **Statement Coverage:** measurement procedure wherein the number of lines of code covered under certain circumstances is calculated based on the inputs from the users.
2. **Branch Coverage:** Branch coverage is a measurement to calculate the number of branches executed per user input.
3. **Mutation Score:** Mutation score is a testing practice wherein we check the accuracy or precision of the test cases.
4. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Cyclomatic Complexity is the measure number of linearly independent paths that can be executed in a program.
5. **Knots** 
6. **Post-release Defect Density**

#### Installation and Configuration for CLOC tool
Depending your operating system, one of these installation methods may work for you:
  npm install -g cloc                    # https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloc
  sudo apt-get install cloc              # Debian, Ubuntu
  sudo yum install cloc                  # Red Hat, Fedora
  sudo pacman -S cloc                    # Arch
  sudo pkg install cloc                  # FreeBSD
  sudo port install cloc                 # Mac OS X with MacPorts
  
For windows operating system, Download the latest cloc.exe and open command prompt and run the following commands
prompt>cloc-1.84

                       cloc -- Count Lines of Code

Usage:
    cloc-1.84.exe [options] <file(s)/dir(s)/git hash(es)>
        Count physical lines of source code and comments in the given files
        (may be archives such as compressed tarballs or zip files) and/or
        recursively below the given directories or git commit hashes.
        Example:    cloc src/ include/ main.c

    cloc-1.84.exe [options] --diff <set1>  <set2>
        Compute differences of physical lines of source code and comments
        between any pairwise combination of directory names, archive
        files or git commit hashes.
        Example:    cloc --diff Python-3.5.tar.xz python-3.6/

cloc-1.84.exe --help  shows full documentation on the options.
https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc has numerous examples and more information.
